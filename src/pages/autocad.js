    <h1>Learning through hands-on exercises</h1>
    <p class="lead">Earlier the architects and engineers could illustrate their ideas only by drawing with free hands. The use of pen and paper has been taken over by design software like AutoCAD. By enabling the designers to create digital designs, the ideas can now be illustrated much faster and with greater efficiency. AutoCAD, which is a computer-aided design software built by Autodesk, helps to draw 2D and 3D designs. There are some well-recognized Autocad training institutes in Banasthali Vidya Peeth, Tonk where people can learn how to use AutoCAD and soon become certified AutoCAD professionals. There are basic, intermediate, and advanced programs in AutoCAD that has been designed for different abilities and needs.</p>
