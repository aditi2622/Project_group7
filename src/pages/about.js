          <p class="lead text-center ">
            APP as an institution is dedicated to higher education, one that
            combines an international reputation for graduate education,
            research, scholarship and creative endeavor with the best
            undergraduate programs available at any public university. APP is
            committed to collaborative transdisciplinary research, inspirational
            artistic endeavors and high-impact educational experiences within an
            environment that advances diversity, equity and inclusion;
            international perspectives; and community engagement. Our campus
            values are described through three words — Unity, Identity and
            Excellence. We are an inclusive community made up of people from
            diverse backgrounds who come together to learn, discover and serve.
            We have developed a common bond — the APP bond — that will be ours
            for a lifetime. We are an academically selective community that
            shares ideas across departments, disciplines and borders. We
            encourage faculty, students and staff to ask unexpected questions,
            foster open dialog and develop innovative solutions to important
            problems. We cannot be all things to all people. However, we pursue
            our goals with determination, striving for intellectual and personal
            growth, especially in the face of adversity.

            The safety of our students and the entire campus community is of the
            highest priority at APP Technical Institute, and we have developed
            comprehensive programs and procedures to help every member of the
            University community remain safe. Our safety efforts touch all
            facets of our students' daily lives, whether in a residence hall,
            classroom, dining facility, office or out and about on campus. A
            campus watch program operates in the residence halls, similar to
            community "neighborhood watch" programs. On-campus escorts are
            available to all members of the University community 24 hours a day,
            365 days a year by calling University Police at 607-777-7777.
            Resident assistants are trained to identify and seek solutions to
            safety and security issues between roommates, floor mates, friends,
            classmates, etc., as well as to properly respond to emergency
            situations. From 9:30 p.m. until 6 a.m., all gates except the main entrance to campus are closed to vehicular traffic and vehicles admitted to campus during this time must be registered to park on campus or the occupants of the vehicle must be hosted by a member of the University community.
82 highly visible, blue-light phones are located outdoors all over campus; these phones connect users directly to the University Police.
Several areas across campus, including women's locker rooms, are equipped with panic alarm buttons that permit direct, immediate communication with University Police.
